# Matching_INE_and_Leaflet

Simple demo to show how to use INE data to plot a choropleth in R, using leaflet. 
For now, just down to provincias. The next update will be to be able to plot municipalities. 

Two folders:
1. cifras_padron, that contains the data from the INE
2. SIANE_CARO_BASE_S_10M that contains the shape files for plotting the leaflet map
